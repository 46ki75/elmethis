# Main Heading (heading)

This is a **bold text** (strong) and this is *italic text* (em). You can also have ~~strikethrough text~~ (del) and \`inline code\` (codespan).

Here are nested inline combinations:
- **Bold text with *italic inside* it** (strong containing em)
- *Italic text with **bold inside** it* (em containing strong)
- **Bold with \`inline code\` inside** (strong containing codespan)
- *Italic with \`inline code\` inside* (em containing codespan)
- ~~Strikethrough with **bold inside** it~~ (del containing strong)
- ~~Strikethrough with *italic inside* it~~ (del containing em)
- ~~Strikethrough with \`inline code\` inside~~ (del containing codespan)
- ***Bold and italic combined*** (strong and em nested)
- **Bold with ~~strikethrough inside~~ it** (strong containing del)
- *Italic with ~~strikethrough inside~~ it* (em containing del)
- \`Code with **bold formatting** inside\` (codespan containing strong - note: this typically won't render as bold in most markdown parsers)

Complex nested examples:
- ***Bold italic with \`code\` inside*** (multiple nesting)
- **Bold with *italic and ~~strikethrough~~* inside** (deep nesting)
- ~~Strikethrough with ***bold italic*** inside~~ (complex nesting)

## Subheading Level 2 (heading)

Here's a regular paragraph (paragraph) with normal text (text). This paragraph contains multiple sentences to test the text token properly.

> This is a blockquote (blockquote)
> It can span multiple lines
> And contain other formatting like **bold** and *italic*

### Code Block (code)

\`\`\`javascript
function example() {
    return "This is a code block";
}
\`\`\`

### Lists (list and list_item)

**Unordered List:**
- First item (list_item)
- Second item with *italic* text (list_item)
- Third item with **bold** text (list_item)
